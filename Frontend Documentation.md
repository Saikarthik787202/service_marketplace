# ðŸŽ¨ Frontend Documentation

## Overview

The frontend is rendered using **EJS templates** served by Express.  
All styling is in `/public/css/style.css`.  
The UI is responsive and role-based (different navigation and features for admin, provider, client).

## Running the Frontend

- The frontend is served by Express; visit [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) after starting the backend.

---

## Extending

- everything is handled through server-rendered EJS views and standard form submissions (POST/GET), not via AJAX or RESTful API endpoints.
